Computational models for understanding sampling issues in studeies of dyadic relationships.

"Marriage_Market_Oct_21_short relations" is a non-spatial, agent-based model of the formation of romantic dyads.  It was developed using the Numerus software (https://www.numerusinc.com/) by Nancy Darling and Ian Burns.  Numerus was developed by Richard Salter. 

The model was designed to examine sampling bias in cross-sectional samples of romantic relationships. We assumed three relationship styles, loosely based on attachment theory: secure, avoidant, and anxious.  Each style differs in mean relationship duration.  Couples are randomly paired, with the duration of the new relationship assigned as the mean of the durations of the two styles.  

Proportion of individuals of each relationship style can be modified. Relationship duration and latency between can be varied. Latency randomly varies around the median duration (e.g., if duration is set to 5, it randomly varies from 1-10.  

This model is the basis of a paper currently in draft by Darling & Burns.  

This model was also used in the following conference presentation:

Attachment Dyads.
